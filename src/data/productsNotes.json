    "GLP-1": [
      "My patient has an allergy to an item in the commercial product.",
      "My patient requires alternate dosing (i.e., microdosing or different titration) based on patient need, clinic protocol, or to decrease side effects.",
      "My patient receives a clinical difference with decreased side effects (nausea, vomiting) with the addition of pyridoxine at the time of injection.",
      "My patient receives a clinical difference from vitamin B supplementation, as the GLP1-RA's delayed gastric emptying may impact nutrient absorption and may affect vitamin B's role in energy metabolism, fatigue, weakness, and neuropathy."
