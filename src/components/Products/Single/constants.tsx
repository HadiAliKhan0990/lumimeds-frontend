        Side effects are typically mild and can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. These side effects
        usually subside within 2-3 weeks, with nausea being considered an &quot;on target&quot; side effect that helps
        reduce your caloric intake. Less common but more serious side effects can include allergic reactions, low blood
        sugar, kidney problems (especially if you are very dehydrated), gallstones and pancreatitis. Thyroid tumors or
        cancer has been observed in rodents, but not yet humans.

        take the injection consistently, on the same day each week. If you need to adjust the day of injection, try to
        avoid injecting within two days of a prior injection. When you forget a dose, make sure to take it within five
        days of the scheduled injection day.

        You are not expected to make strict dietary changes during the plan, but most patients naturally consume fewer
        calories. As constipation is a side effect to look out for, we recommend having a diet rich in fiber and
        drinking plenty of water, as doing so can minimize constipation.
